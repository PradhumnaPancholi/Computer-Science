# Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, & Machines

## Intro

This repository is contains the things I learned while fillowing the [couse](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines/home/welcome) on Coursera. Main difference being the use of python instead of Java.

This repository contains code examples in python while pursuing the course. I addition to that, I made a few attempts beyond just "following lectures" to understand the concepts a bit better.

## The Course Contains:

1. Sorting & Searching
(will keep adding data as soon as I finish the topic)
