# Data Structure VS Data Type

## Data Structure

1. Data structure represents data.
2. Data structures reflect relationship between data.
3. Some are built-in like arrays and dictionaries. (depends on the language)
4. Others are not like linked list and treemap.

## Data Type

1. Data types are set of value.
2. There are set of operations available on those values. (Eg:- concat on strings)
3. Examples of built in data types are int, boolean, and string.
4. Examples for user-defined data types can be anything like User, Person, Client, and Post.
